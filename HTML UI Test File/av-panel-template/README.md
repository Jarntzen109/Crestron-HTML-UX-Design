# AV Panel Template
### React + Vite + CH5 — Visual Component Library for Crestron Touch Panels

---

## The Concept

This template is a **visual component library** — a parts bin.
Your programmers design pages by copying pre-built components, dropping
them into a page file, and wiring join numbers to their own SIMPL programs.
No custom CSS, no wrestling with Crestron Construct.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` — you'll see whatever page is currently
set as `ACTIVE_PAGE` in `src/App.tsx`. To browse every available
component (the parts bin), open `src/App.tsx` and set `ACTIVE_PAGE`
to `<ComponentLibrary />`. When you're building or previewing a
specific room instead, point `ACTIVE_PAGE` at that page's component —
whatever's set there is what loads when you open the dev server.

---

## The Build Workflow (for programmers)

### Step 1 — Browse components
In `src/App.tsx`, set `ACTIVE_PAGE` to `<ComponentLibrary />` and open
the dev server. That page shows everything available: buttons, grouped
buttons, PTZ joystick, sliders, gauges, layout containers.

### Step 2 — Create your page file
Duplicate `src/pages/ExampleRoom.tsx` and rename it (e.g. `AudioControl.tsx`).
Delete the `Positioned` blocks you don't need, then build up your own —
the comment block at the top of that file walks through the actual
step-by-step loop used to build it, control by control.

### Step 3 — Copy-paste components
Copy a component block from `ComponentLibrary.tsx` into your page.
For example, a camera select group:

```tsx
<GroupBox title="Cameras" width={150}>
  <AVButtonGroup>
    <AVButton label="Audience"  joinNumber={1} size="lg" />
    <AVButton label="Presenter" joinNumber={2} size="lg" />
  </AVButtonGroup>
</GroupBox>
```

### Step 3b — Or drag-position instead of hand-editing CSS
Most components (`GroupBox`, flex rows, etc.) lay out with normal CSS
flex/grid. If you'd rather freely place things by dragging — closer to
how Construct's canvas works — wrap them in `LayoutCanvas` +
`Positioned` instead:

```tsx
const POSITIONS = {
  camAudience: { x: 20, y: 20, w: 140, h: 72 },
  camPresenter: { x: 180, y: 20, w: 140, h: 72 },
};

<LayoutCanvas width={device.width - 32} height={device.height - 96}>
  <Positioned id="camAudience" {...POSITIONS.camAudience}>
    <AVButton label="Audience" joinNumber={1} />
  </Positioned>
  <Positioned id="camPresenter" {...POSITIONS.camPresenter}>
    <AVButton label="Presenter" joinNumber={2} />
  </Positioned>
</LayoutCanvas>
```

Click **Edit Layout** in the canvas corner, drag components to where
you want them (snaps to an 8px grid), then **Copy Positions** — it
copies an updated `POSITIONS` object to your clipboard. Paste it back
over the one in your page file to persist the new layout. Try it live
in the Component Library page under "LayoutCanvas + Positioned."

### Step 4 — Set your join numbers
Replace `joinNumber={1}` etc. with whatever digital/analog joins
your SIMPL program uses. The `joinNumber` prop is just a visual label in dev —
the actual CH5 wiring happens in your own `useCrestron` hook or directly
in the component's `onPress`/`onChange` callbacks.

### Step 5 — Wire CH5 in the callbacks (optional, your method)
Each component exposes `onPress`, `onRelease`, `onChange` props.
Wire them however your team handles CH5 — use CrComLib directly,
wrap in your own hook, whatever your standard is.

This template calls `CrComLib` directly in these callbacks rather than
using Crestron's native CH5 web components (`<ch5-button>` and similar,
which route joins on their own). That's deliberate: those components
would conflict with the `LayoutCanvas` drag-and-drop editor (Step 3b),
which depends on plain React components and normal pointer events.
Don't swap in CH5's native elements — it'll break drag-to-place.

```tsx
<AVButton
  label="Audience"
  joinNumber={1}
  variant="toggle"
  onPress={() => CrComLib.publishEvent('boolean', '1', true)}
  onRelease={() => CrComLib.publishEvent('boolean', '1', false)}
/>
```

### Step 6 — Switch App.tsx to your page
In `src/App.tsx`, add an import for your new page file and change
`ACTIVE_PAGE` to your new page component.

`ExampleRoom.tsx` is the one worked example this template ships with,
built with `LayoutCanvas` + `Positioned` (drag-to-place) — that's the
recommended default for new rooms since it's the easiest to hand to
someone who's never used this template before: drag things where they
belong, copy the coordinates, paste them in.

Plain flex/grid (hand-written `style={{ display: 'flex', ... }}`
containers, no `LayoutCanvas`) still works fine for a page that's
mostly simple rows and columns — it's just not what the shipped
example demonstrates.

### Step 7 — Retarget device if needed
In `src/config/devices.ts`, change `ACTIVE_DEVICE`:
- `'ts570'`   → Crestron TSW-570          (1280×720, landscape)
- `'ts570p'`  → Crestron TSW-570P         (720×1280, **portrait**)
- `'ts770'`   → Crestron TS-770           (1280×800, landscape)
- `'ts880'`   → Crestron TS-880           (1280×800, landscape)
- `'ts1070'`  → Crestron TS-1070          (1920×1200, landscape)
- `'ts1080'`  → Crestron TS-1080/TST-1080 (1920×1200, landscape)

Resolutions are verified against Crestron's published specs. Note TS-1070
and TS-1080 are the same 1920×1200 panel size but were previously
mis-set to 1280×800 in an earlier revision of this template — if you
built anything against those old dimensions, re-check the layout.

### Step 8 — Package and deploy
```bash
npm run package
```
This builds the app and packages it into `dist/av-panel-template.ch5z`
— a single file ready to load onto a touch panel. Each panel/room is
its own build: package once per `ACTIVE_PAGE` you set in Step 6.

Load the `.ch5z` onto the panel with either:
- **Toolbox** → Web Pages and Mobility Projects, drag in the `.ch5z`, or
- The panel's own **Project Upload** page (its local web config UI —
  browse to the panel's IP, find Applications → Project Upload)

Both are self-contained: once uploaded, the panel runs the project
from its own storage, no server or network dependency needed to keep
it running. (`ch5-cli deploy` is also available for scripted deploys —
see the CH5 CLI docs — but isn't necessary for a one-off upload.)

## Switching Between Device Profiles — What Actually Needs to Change

Flipping `ACTIVE_DEVICE` always resizes the canvas. What else your page
needs depends on *how* you built it and *how different* the new target is:

### Same orientation, different size (e.g. TS-770 → TS-1070)
Pages built with normal flex/grid mostly reflow on their own — columns
using `flex: 1` absorb the extra width, `GroupBox` widths stay fixed.
Still eyeball it: a 640px gain in width going from TS-770 to TS-1070
usually shows up as dead space on the right rather than broken layout,
but check spacing/proportions before calling it done.

If the page uses `LayoutCanvas` + `Positioned` (drag-placed), the
coordinates are pixel-absolute and **do not scale**. A button dragged
to `x: 1800` will sit off-canvas on a 1280-wide panel. For a page that
needs to support multiple resolutions, keep a separate `POSITIONS`
object per device and pick one based on `ACTIVE_DEVICE`:

```tsx
import { ACTIVE_DEVICE } from '../config/devices';

const POSITIONS_BY_DEVICE = {
  ts770:  { camAudience: { x: 20, y: 20, w: 140, h: 72 } /* ... */ },
  ts1070: { camAudience: { x: 40, y: 40, w: 160, h: 84 } /* ... */ },
};
const POSITIONS = POSITIONS_BY_DEVICE[ACTIVE_DEVICE] ?? POSITIONS_BY_DEVICE.ts770;
```

### Portrait (TSW-570P)
This isn't a resize — width and height swap, so a 3-column landscape
layout has nowhere to go. **Build a dedicated page** for portrait
targets rather than reusing a landscape page; duplicate a page file the
same way you would for any new page (Step 2 above) and stack content
vertically instead of in columns.

To catch someone pointing a landscape page at a portrait device (or
vice versa) by mistake, declare the orientation the page was built for
and `PanelLayout` will show a full-screen warning if it doesn't match
`ACTIVE_DEVICE`:

```tsx
<PanelLayout expectOrientation="landscape">
```

`ExampleRoom.tsx` and `ComponentLibrary.tsx` both do this already —
try setting `ACTIVE_DEVICE` to `'ts570p'` and reloading to see it fire.

**One line change. Everything snaps to the new canvas size.**

## Theming

All visual values live in `src/styles/tokens.css` as CSS custom properties.
Change colors, border radius, font — the entire UI updates.

Key variables:
```css
--av-accent          /* active/selected color (default: blue) */
--av-bg-page         /* page background */
--av-bg-elevated     /* button background */
--av-border-default  /* button borders */
--av-text-primary    /* main text */
--av-green           /* success / power on */
--av-red             /* danger / power off */
```

---

## Hiding Join Labels Before Deployment

The `joinNumber` prop renders a small faint label (e.g. `D1`, `A3`) during
development for easy SIMPL cross-referencing. Before deploying to a panel,
set this in `tokens.css`:

```css
--av-join-opacity: 0;
```

All join labels disappear across the entire UI instantly.
